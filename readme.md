A user's home directory is intended to contain that user's files; including
text documents, etc. It may also include their configuration files of
preferred settings for any software they have used there and might have
tailored to their liking: web browser bookmarks, etc. The user can install
executable software in this directory, but it will only be available to users
with permission to this directory. The home directory can be organized further
with the use of sub-directories.
