# How to fwrite to removable volume

Given this example file:

    $ cat 'F:\alfa.txt'
    bravo

I can write to the file easily:

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
      FILE* ju = fopen("F:\\alfa.txt", "r+");
      fwrite("Z", 1, 1, ju);
    }

Result:

    $ cat 'F:\alfa.txt'
    Zravo

and I can read from the volume:

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
      char ki[6];
      FILE* ju = fopen("\\\\.\\F:", "r");
      fseek(ju, 0x1004000, SEEK_SET);
      fread(ki, 1, 5, ju);
      puts(ki);
    }

Result:

    $ ./program
    Zravo

However writing to the volume appears to have no effect:

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
      FILE* ju = fopen("\\\\.\\F:", "r+b");
      fseek(ju, 0x1004000, SEEK_SET);
      fwrite("b", 1, 1, ju);
    }

Result:

    $ cat 'F:\alfa.txt'
    Zravo

How can I write to the volume in this manner?

# Answer

You can do this, but some considerations need to be made:

1. Seeking, reading and writing must all be done in multiples of sector size, in
   my case 512 bytes

2. `CreateFile` must be invoked with `dwShareMode` set to 0, to prevent other
   processes from opening the device. Alternatively you can use
   `DeviceIoControl` with `FSCTL_LOCK_VOLUME`

3. I did this with Windows API. Equivalent commands for locking are
   `fcntl(..., F_ETLK, ...)` or `flock(..., LOCK_EX)` or
   `lockf(..., F_LOCK, ...)`, none of which are supported with Windows.
   [A patch][1] was proposed in 2008

Example:

    #include <windows.h>
    #define BYTES_PER_SEC 512
    #define DIST_TO_MOVE 0x1004000
    int main() {
      DWORD li;
      char ki[BYTES_PER_SEC];
      HANDLE ju = CreateFile("\\\\.\\F:", GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL,
        OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
      SetFilePointer(ju, DIST_TO_MOVE, NULL, FILE_BEGIN);
      ReadFile(ju, ki, sizeof ki, &li, NULL);
      ki[0] = 'Z';
      SetFilePointer(ju, DIST_TO_MOVE, NULL, FILE_BEGIN);
      WriteFile(ju, ki, sizeof ki, &li, NULL);
    }
